This is what's running on https://vulpine.club/, more or less. No warranties, it could destroy everything.

This is a fork of https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon (hereafter referred to as "glitchsoc"), which is itself a fork of https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon ("tootsuite").

### Local features ###

See: [diff of glitch-soc/mastodon:master and vulpineclub/mastodon:master](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/compare/master...vulpineclub:master)

Highlights:

- Foxes occur whereever possible
- Docker-centered deployment process
- Native IPv6 for all external-facing interfaces

### Branches ###

- `master`: regular merges from glitchsoc/master, hotfixes and features from tootsuite, local modifications and experimental crap
- `staging`: pre-production smoke tests, where I make sure it runs and looks okay and has basic functionality in a Vagrant-encrusted VM
- `production`: this is what is actually deployed on vulpine.club

The `production` branch is automatically built on Docker Hub at [vulpineclub/mastodon](https://hub.docker.com/r/vulpineclub/mastodon/).
